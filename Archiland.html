When we first met the Archi team, they instantly made us feel comfortable and understood what we were trying to achieve.
We ended up doing two projects back to back and the Archi team brought the same level of enthusiasm and creativity to both projects.
We really enjoyed the collaboration process and all our feedback was positively taken on board. The Archi team never made us feel like any request was too hard and always seemed to solve even the trickiest problems. 
We look forward to continuing our relationship for future projects.<br><br><em style="float:right;color:green;border: none;">Project By-<em><strong style="float:right;color:green;border: none;">Thilina jathunarachchi</strong>

When commencing the design of our family home on the river, I knew I needed a specialist Interior designer to achieve that next level of design. 
They delivered! Not only a thoughtful, considered and ultimately beautiful interior, but one that worked perfectly with the architecture.
After living in our house for almost a year, we can honestly say that we adore living in it. 
Our design team was fantastic, and the level of detail was truly unbelievable. Everybody that comes to our house comments on how beautiful it is. 
What makes it even more special is the fact it was tailor-made for our family.

The Community Co worked with Archi team on a project at 30 Hollins Crescent New Farm 4005 over the last 24 months.
We have been most impressed with the ability of Archi team to manage and deliver this large project from concept work right through to construction within required timeframes and budgeted figures.
The team at Archi team hold themselves to an excellent standard and are very easy and personable to work alongside.
We believe Archi team is a fantastic option to consider for your upcoming project.
We highly recommend Archi team if you are searching for quality architectural and interior design services. They are organised, efficient and, most importantly, creative.

Natalie from archi team has helped me to design the layout and interior of my practice, and followed through the fitting out process. Working with Archi team was a great experience. They truly value their customer and listen to their needs. The results were amazing and matches what I wanted in my initial concept. The team were great to work with, they are friendly and approachable and most importantly they listen to their customer needs and incorporate those important elements into the design.
 A very special thank you to Natalie in making this project possible.
